# 今天没有学习计划，心有迷茫的时候，停下来好好看看世界和内心。
# 虽然结束的那一刻，更多的是释然，可为什么我的心态和心智却受了极大的影响呢。我以为我们会一直在一起，我以为找到一个人是如此，难道说这次失败让我认识到我的自信也有失误的如此地步的时候，伤害的其实很深吗。

# I can literally feel that I tend to use English as my mindset-language.I'm so done having enough resouces but giving out way less effort.It's like letting the early version of me down.
# Everyone I know is encouageing me ,they trust me for this.But it's like in me genes that I'm not that type of man who would pay all his attention on sth.Even if I love it so much.
# I know what I want.However,I assume getting it means giving up my original gift.That's eliminating my quantities,right?

# I was sure that I'm walking on the right road and I'm gaining what;s way beyond my peers.I guess that's my superpower-resouce searching and marvolous comprehenging skills.It's quite clear that what's hindering my progress and the answer is myself. I'm afraid to set foot in the area I'm not familar with.Am I giving myself enough patience or way opposite? I'm really confused.

# After all,I decide to simplfy my life and scedule.

# About math:do the ZhangClass everyday.

# About programing:get to the point!!!  Get used to C language as fast as you can!!! Don't forget the data stucture and algorithm.

# You've done good enough,breathe in and out. Remember that. When the time comes,trust your intuition and body memory, don't do overwhelming thinking.
